# Tasks

---
1. The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer $x$ and repeatedly apply the function $f(x)$ below, you always get stuck in the repeating sequence $1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ...$
Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for the first 10,000 positive integers.

$$
f(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
n \div 2 & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
3n + 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}
$$

2. Give an overview of the famous penguins data set, explaining the types of variables it contains. Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model them in Python, explaining your rationale.

3. For each of the variables in the penguins data set, suggest what probability distribution from the numpy random distributions list is the most appropriate to model the variable.

4. Suppose you are flipping two coins, each with a probability $p$ of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads versus $p$.

5. Create an appropriate individual plot for each of the variables in the penguin data set.

# Project
---

The project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher. 

In the notebook, you should discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python.

Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summarystatistics to describe each variable.

Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for each variable.

The notebook should follow a cohesive narrative about the data set.
